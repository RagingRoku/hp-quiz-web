            of the spitting fire. 'The Boy Who Lived.'' None of the Death Eaters
            moved. They were waiting. Everything was waiting. Hagrid was
            struggling, and Bellatrix was panting, and Harry thought
            inexplicably of Ginny, and her blazing look, and the feel of her
            lips on his-- Voldemort had raised his wand. His head was still
            tilted to one side, like a curious child, wondering what would
            happen if he proceeded. Harry looked back into the red eyes, and
            wanted it to happen now, quickly, while he could still stand, before
            he lost control, before he betrayed fear-- He saw the mouth move and
            a flash of green light, and everything was gone.
